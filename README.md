# TOP-Landing-Page
The second full project assignment of TOP's Foundations Course.

The aim of this assignment was to create a single webpage.
This page was to mirror the formatting of an example webpage given by the project creators.
It was then to have custom contend added where placeholders were present in TOP example.

This piece of work showcases my skills using HTML and CSS, as well as Flexbox.
